permalink: /publication/2021-1-24-MatchingPhrases
excerpt: 'This paper is about providing an account of Norwegian object shift within Match Theory. We show that Match Theory is well suited to account for the shifting of pronominal objects if the MATCH constraints are sensitive to lexical elements only. This observation is in contrast with Elfner's (2012) findings that MATCH should be sensitive to both lexical and functional elements.'
